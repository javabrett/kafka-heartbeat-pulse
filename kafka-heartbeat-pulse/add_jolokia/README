This repo uses InfluxDB & Grafana for heartbeat cycles. 
Usage can be expanded from heartbeat cycles only to JMX metric collection from all services.
To do this, make the following edits to the docker-compose.yml


1/ Move the "jolokia" subdirectory in this directory to the same directory as docker-compose.yml
mv add_jolokia/jolokia .

2/ Mount the jolokia volume to all JVM containers that you want to monitor (usually kafka, kSQL and Connect)
   For each container, edit this:
    volumes:
      - ./log4j-injected:/etc/kafka/log4j-injected

   to this:
    volumes:
      - ./log4j-injected:/etc/kafka/log4j-injected
      - ./jolokia:/opt/jolokia

3/ Include the Jolokia jarfile into each JVM. Edit docker-compose to add this line to the same containers
   KAFKA_OPTS: "-javaagent:/opt/jolokia/jolokia.jar=host=0.0.0.0"
